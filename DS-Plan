1. Data Structure Planning Table

| Operation | Data Structure | Reason for Choosing DS |
| --------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Add Stop  | Singly Linked List (`RouteNode`) | Allows dynamic memory allocation to add an unlimited number of stops without re-sizing, and models the sequential nature of a bus route (Stop A -> Stop B). |

| Add Passenger | Queue (Array Implementation) | Passengers arrive in a specific order and must be served First-In-First-Out (FIFO). |
| Undo Update | Stack (Array `routeHistory`) | We need to revert to the most recent previous state. Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) is the exact behavior required for undo operations. |

2. Operation Flow Explanation

Operation: Add Stop to Route
*What it does: Appends a new specific location (stop) to the end of the current transport route.
* Data Structure: Singly Linked List.
* Why it is suitable: Transport routes are sequential. A Linked List allows us to start at the `Head` (first stop) and traverse to the end to add a new stop efficiently without needing to know the total size of the route beforehand.
* User Interaction:
    1.  User selects "1. Add Stop to Route" from the menu.
    2.  System prompts "Enter stop name:".
    3.  User inputs a string (e.g., "Main Street").
    4.  System confirms "Added stop: Main Street" and updates the route history for undo functionality.

Operation: Add Passenger to Queue
* What it does: Adds a waiting passenger to the end of the line.
* Data Structure: Queue (Array).
* Why it is suitable: A Queue enforces fairness (FIFO). The first person to arrive (`front`) should board first, and new people join at the `rear`.
* User Interaction:
    1.  User selects "5. Add Passenger to Queue".
    2.  System asks "Enter passenger name:".
    3.  User inputs name (e.g., "Alice").
    4.  System adds Alice to the `rear` index and confirms.
